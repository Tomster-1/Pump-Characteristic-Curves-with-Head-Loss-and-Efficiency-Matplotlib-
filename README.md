# Pump-Characteristic-Curves-with-Head-Loss-and-Efficiency-Matplotlib-
Python script to visualise pump characteristic curves, total head loss, and efficiency versus flow rate using dual y-axes in Matplotlib.
This repository contains a Python script that plots pump performance characteristics for a 1.2 m impeller operating at 800 RPM. The code visualises key hydraulic relationships using Matplotlib with shared and twin y-axes.

Features:

Head–flow (H–Q) characteristic curve

System total head loss plotted on the same axis as pump head

Pump efficiency plotted on a secondary y-axis

Combined, vertically stacked legend for clarity

Clear labelling suitable for engineering reports and coursework

The script is intended for engineering analysis and coursework visualisation, demonstrating how pump curves intersect with system losses to identify operating points.
